## Analysis and Challenges
* Bob's manager commmisioned me with the assignment of determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

### Analysis of Outcome
* We can deduce that there will be a great need to hire several qualified individuals as the silver tsunami of retirees will leave a great void in the workforce.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* It was difficult to conceptualize the primary and foreign key concept initially

## Results
* As there are not enough qualified employees when the mass retiring takes place we recommend manager Bob needs to begin traning 6 months to a year before employees retire to maintain proper company operations.
